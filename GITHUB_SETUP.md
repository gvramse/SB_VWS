# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Repository Preparation Complete ✅

The SB Volunteer Workflow System codebase has been cleaned, organized, and committed to a local git repository. Here's what was accomplished:

### Code Cleanup Completed:
- ✅ Removed unnecessary documentation files (LOGOUT_FIX.md, QUICK_FIX.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)
- ✅ Removed redundant scripts (start_server.bat, start.py)
- ✅ Fixed spelling typos in headers ("SB Vounteer" → "SB Volunteer")
- ✅ Organized project structure with proper documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive .gitignore file
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt with clean dependency management
- ✅ Enhanced README.md with complete project documentation

### Git Repository Status:
- ✅ Local git repository initialized
- ✅ All 43 files committed with descriptive commit message
- ✅ Clean project structure ready for GitHub

## Next Steps: Upload to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New" or "+" button to create a new repository
3. Name it: `sb-volunteer-workflow-system` (or your preferred name)
4. Add description: "Django-based task management system for Samskrita Bharati USA volunteers"
5. Keep it **Private** initially (recommended for organizational projects)
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
Run these commands in the project directory:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload
After pushing, verify on GitHub:
- All 43 files should be visible
- README.md should display the project information
- Check that sensitive files (.env) are properly ignored

### 4. Repository Settings (Recommended)
1. **Security**: Enable vulnerability alerts
2. **Branches**: Protect main branch (require pull requests)
3. **Collaborators**: Add team members as needed
4. **Secrets**: Add environment variables for deployment:
   - `SECRET_KEY`
   - `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`
